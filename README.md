# arduino-robot-tutorial

The following pages introduce you into a world of embedded programming in AVR-based
[Arduino platform](https://www.arduino.cc/).

This repository is organized into the following directories:

* [Tutorial](https://krkruk.github.io/arduino-robot-tutorial/) or [`docs`](docs/README.md) if you prefer to read raw Markdown files. The core tutorial you need.
* `mini-robot` - this directory contains all intermediate code samples as well as the final code that can be simply uploaded to your Arduino microcontroller given you follow all the suggestions presented in the tutorial
* `3d_models` - all necessary STL files (including Solid Edge Community editable versions) to print your own robot!

The tutorial assumes you are at least familiar with C-lang-like language. It is not meant
to teach anyone how to code in AVR/Arduino from scratch. It's more like a getting started
for anyone who has some experience at coding.

Remember, education is important. Consider signing up for a university course. I'm just
a random guy in the Internet ;). Don't trust in anything you read... The tutorial likely has some issues with it, sometimes it may be misleading etc. Common sense is your friend, Google (or any search engine) is your bestie, an AI... will replace you, or not.

## Disclaimer

All presented materials serve educational purposes only. Working with electricity
poses hazard to your health and life. If you decide to follow the tutorial,
you do it at your own risk. You can get destroy your electronic components (i.e., ESD - electrostatic discharge), get electrocuted, burn down your surroundings. You have been warned!

Similarly, 3D printing comes with it's own risks. My first cheap 3D printer caught fire twice...
You need some basic skills to operate FDM/FFF printer. Please refer to your printer user
manual. Remember, you do it at your risk!
